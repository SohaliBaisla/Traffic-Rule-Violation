# Traffic-Rule-Violation

This project focuses on the development of a sophisticated traffic rule violation detection system using video processing techniques to enhance road safety. The system integrates computer vision algorithms for speed detection, red light violation identification, and license plate recognition utilizing EasyOCR and Tesseract technologies.

- Implemented a robust speed detection algorithm to identify overspeeding vehiclesnts.
- Developed a real-time red light violation detection mechanism.
- Integrated a highly accurate license plate recognition system, aiding law enforcement in effectively tracking violators.
